RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 platform_i/aesVerifyPlatformData_0/inst/aes_verify_platform_data_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/asyfifo/dualport_ram/mem_reg has an input control pin platform_i/aesVerifyPlatformData_0/inst/aes_verify_platform_data_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/asyfifo/dualport_ram/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[5] (net: platform_i/aesVerifyPlatformData_0/inst/aes_verify_platform_data_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/asyfifo/dualport_ram/Q[0]) which is driven by a register (platform_i/aesVerifyPlatformData_0/inst/aes_verify_platform_data_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/top/asyfifo/rlogic/rbincounter_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
