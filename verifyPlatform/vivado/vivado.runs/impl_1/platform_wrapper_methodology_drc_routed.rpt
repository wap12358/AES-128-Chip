LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell platform_i/aes_top_0/inst/aes_iset/div_count_reg[1]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) platform_i/aes_top_0/inst/aes_iset/div_count_reg[0]_P/PRE, platform_i/aes_top_0/inst/aes_iset/div_count_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
